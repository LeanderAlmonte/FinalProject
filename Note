Note:
Due to repository issues, we made a second repository and worked on there for a few days until i managed to fix the issue on this repository. So Luke had a commit from the other repository where he created all the java files and implemented all the class members and some methods.
So essentially the commit called "Another commit" includes my changes and luke's changes at the same time where I worked on GUIs and Luke did the java classes.
