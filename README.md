Programming Patterns Final Project: Arena Ticket Reservation System

The Arena Ticket Reservation System is an application where users can search and buy tickets for different events at an arena. They can select events like sports, concerts and spectacles. Technicians will handle the availability and booking of a ticket by a user and handle the transactions. The user may refund a ticket and view the tickets they bought and their transactions. 

Functionalities:

User:
- Search for ticket 
- Book Ticket 
- Refund Ticket 
- View Ticket(s) 
- View Transactions 

Technician:
- Assign tickets 
- Validate Tickets
- Handle transactions
- View Total Tickets sold and users that bought them

Output:
The program will display options for the user to pick their desired ticket(s). Once validated by the technician, the user will go through the transaction to buy the ticket then the program will output the full details of the ticket and the receipt.
When a user wants to do a refund, the program will ask which ticket they want to refund, and then the technician will execute the refund and display the transaction details.
