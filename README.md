Programming Patterns Final Project: Arena Ticket Booking System

The Arena Ticket Booking System is an application where users can search and buy tickets for different events at an
arena. The price of a ticket will depend on the section of the seat and the event type. They can select events like
sports, concerts and spectacles. Technicians will handle the availability and booking of a ticket by a user and handle
the transactions. The user may refund a ticket and view the tickets they bought and their transactions.

Output:
The program begins with a log in screen where, depending on the credentials entered, the program will determine whether
the user is a regular user or a technician.
If it is a user, the program will display options for the user to pick their desired ticket(s). Once validated by the
technician, the user will go through the transaction to buy the ticket then the program will output the full details of
the ticket and the receipt.
When a user wants to do a refund, the program will ask which ticket they want to refund, and then the technician will
execute the refund and display the transaction details.
At any time, the user may view the their purchased tickets and their transactions. The technician may also at any time
view the total tickets sold and the users associated with those tickets.
The program ends once the current user logs out.
